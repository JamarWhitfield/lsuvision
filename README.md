# LSU Vision Group — Starter Site

This repository is a lightweight static scaffold for the LSU Vision research group website.

## What to download
- **Node.js** (LTS, v18+ recommended) — https://nodejs.org/
- **Git** (optional but recommended) — https://git-scm.com/
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code)

## Quick start
1. Install dev dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run a local dev server: `npm start` (serves on port 5173)
3. Edit files: update `index.html`, `about.html`, `people.html`, `research.html`, `publications.html`, add images to `assets/img` and data to `data/`.

## Deployment ideas
- Host as a static site on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

If you'd like, I can add a CI workflow for auto-deploy to GitHub Pages next.
